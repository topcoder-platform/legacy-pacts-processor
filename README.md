Migration script used to migrate Challenges, Resources, and Resource Roles from Informix to DynamoDB.
It runs on a scheduled basis and also on-demand by exposing an API allowing admins to manually trigger the migration.

-  [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/)(v6.3.1)
-  [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)
-  [Informix](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/informix)
-  [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)(CE 17+)
-  [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

## Local Deployment
### Foreman Setup
To install foreman follow this [link](https://theforeman.org/manuals/1.24/#3.InstallingForeman)
To know how to use foreman follow this [link](https://theforeman.org/manuals/1.24/#2.Quickstart) 

If you run something with `nf run npm run <something>` instead of `npm run <something>`, it'll load in a `.env` file from the root of the project

### Deployment
 To simplify deployment, we're using docker. To build the images
or run the container:
```
cd <legacy-challenge-migration-cli>/docker
docker-compose up
```
This will automatically build the image if have not done this before.
After container has been run, go to container shell and install dependencies:

```
docker exec -ti legacy-challenge-migration-cli bash
npm i
```

### Command for API
- Inside the docker container, start the express server: `npm start`

## Migrations
### For local migrations
There are two parts need to be updated for local migrations,
- `./src/models/challenge.js`
`throughput: 'ON_DEMAND',` should be updated to `throughput:{ read: 4, write: 2 },`
- `./config/default.js`
Two aws config should be uncommented

and env variable `IS_LOCAL_DB` should be set to true before you continue to the next steps.

### Run a migration
- To run a migration, the command should be:
`MIGRATION=<name-of-migration-file> nf run npm run migrate`
Example: 
`MIGRATION=001-migrate-taskData nf run npm run migrate`
